## General info
This project is to find student accomodation in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Available rooms provided by student housing organizations are usually sold out within seconds on a first-come-first-served base. In this project I built a web-scraping bot to immediatly send a notification as soon as an acoomodation becomes free.
